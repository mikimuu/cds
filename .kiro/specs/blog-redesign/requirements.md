# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves a complete redesign and re-architecture of an existing Next.js blog to create a more lightweight, user-friendly, and visually appealing platform. The current blog is deployed on Vercel and requires manual git commits for content updates. The redesign will focus on three core areas: performance optimization through lightweight architecture, seamless content management with direct upload capabilities, and a sophisticated typography-focused editorial design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog author, I want a lightweight and fast-loading blog platform, so that my readers have an optimal experience and my hosting costs remain minimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the blog loads THEN the initial page load SHALL be under 2 seconds on 3G connections
2. WHEN analyzing bundle size THEN the JavaScript bundle SHALL be reduced by at least 50% from current implementation
3. WHEN measuring Core Web Vitals THEN the site SHALL achieve scores of 90+ for Performance, Accessibility, and SEO
4. IF a user visits any page THEN the system SHALL serve optimized images with appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF)
5. WHEN content is requested THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies for static assets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog author, I want to upload and publish content directly through the website interface, so that I can avoid the complexity of using VS Code and git commits for every post.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin interface THEN the system SHALL provide a secure authentication mechanism
2. WHEN I create a new post THEN the system SHALL offer a rich text editor with markdown support
3. WHEN I upload images THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize and store them with proper file management
4. WHEN I save a draft THEN the system SHALL preserve my work without publishing it publicly
5. WHEN I publish a post THEN the system SHALL immediately make it available on the live site
6. WHEN I edit existing content THEN the system SHALL allow real-time updates without requiring technical knowledge
7. IF I upload media files THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (images, videos, documents)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to experience beautiful typography and editorial-style design, so that reading content feels engaging and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL implement a carefully crafted typographic hierarchy
2. WHEN reading articles THEN the text SHALL use optimal line spacing, character spacing, and measure for readability
3. WHEN the design loads THEN it SHALL feature editorial-style layouts with proper white space and visual rhythm
4. IF viewing on different devices THEN the typography SHALL scale appropriately and maintain readability
5. WHEN browsing the site THEN the design SHALL feel cohesive with consistent spacing, colors, and type treatments
6. WHEN reading long-form content THEN the system SHALL provide comfortable reading experience with proper contrast ratios
7. IF accessing the site THEN the design SHALL support both light and dark reading modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the new architecture to be maintainable and scalable, so that future updates and feature additions are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new system THEN it SHALL use modern, well-supported technologies
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the codebase SHALL follow consistent patterns and conventions
3. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support automated deployment processes
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and error handling
5. WHEN scaling content THEN the architecture SHALL handle increased traffic and content volume efficiently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to migrate existing content seamlessly, so that no historical posts or data are lost during the redesign.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating content THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing blog posts with their metadata
2. WHEN transferring images THEN all media files SHALL be properly migrated and linked
3. WHEN updating URLs THEN the system SHALL maintain SEO rankings through proper redirects
4. IF external links exist THEN they SHALL continue to function after migration
5. WHEN the migration completes THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved or improved
